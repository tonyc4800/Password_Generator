# Password_Generator
Simple application that 'randomly' generates a set of 5 passwords. I wanted to change passwrods to various accounts that I have on the web to be randomized. I am sure I could have easily googled a random password generator. However, I figured it would be fun to just write my own program for it.
* C# 6.0 syntax used.
